Someone experienced in design would have chosen other models to completely circumvent the use of a toggle button.  Flat UI and NO UI is hard, very hard.  You need an experience designer to make it work right.  We needed to be more explicit, if we were to empower Developers to design their own apps.-->

	Discuss the naming convention

		Put the reset at the component level so that it can inherit from a theme as well as behave as a peice of a whole in the component
	Cascade
		Allows theme styles like font, font-weight, background color etc. to cascade intelligently instead of fighting with browser defaults.
		This will happen at a component level instead of at a global or page level so that html elements will behave as expected when not
		used in a component context
